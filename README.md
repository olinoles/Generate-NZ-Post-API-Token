<h2>Description:</h2>  

A really basic PHP script to retrieve an API token for the NZ Post API. I use this for retrieving a client token for my address validator script.
API keys need to be kept secret, so a backend token generator is required when making client calls to the NZ Post API.
<h2>Compatibility:</h2>  

Tested on Wordpress up to PHP 7.4

<h2>Use:</h2>  

Host this file on your webserver and use it to retrieve an API token when needed for client calls to the NZ Post API.  
You will need an NZ Post API client ID and client secret. Don't forget to insert your referal URL on Line 18.

<h2>Security:</h2>  

Be mindful where you host this file and who can access it. This script would contain your secret API keys which should remain secret obviously :)

<h2>Issues:</h2>  

If you come across any issues or concerns while using this script, please let me know.
